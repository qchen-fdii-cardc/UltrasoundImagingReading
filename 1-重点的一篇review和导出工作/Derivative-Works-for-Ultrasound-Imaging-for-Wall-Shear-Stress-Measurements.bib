abstract = {The assessment of local blood flow patterns in patients with peripheral arterial disease is clinically relevant, since these patterns are related to atherosclerotic disease progression and loss of patency in stents placed in peripheral arteries, through mechanisms such as recirculating flow and low wall shear stress (WSS). However, imaging of vascular flow in these patients is technically challenging due to the often complex flow patterns that occur near atherosclerotic lesions. While several flow quantification techniques have been developed that could improve the outcomes of vascular interventions, accurate 2D or 3D blood flow quantification is not yet used in clinical practice. This article provides an overview of several important topics that concern the quantification of blood flow in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The hemodynamic mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerosis and the current clinical practice in the diagnosis of this disease are discussed, showing the unmet need for improved and validated flow quantification techniques in daily clinical practice. This discussion is followed by a showcase of state-of-the-art blood flow quantification techniques and how these could be used before, during and after treatment of stenotic lesions to improve clinical outcomes. These techniques include novel ultrasound-based methods, Phase-Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PC-MRI) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The last section discusses future perspectives, with advanced (hybrid) imaging techniques and artificial intelligence, including the implementation of these techniques in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Purpose Analysis of local blood flow patterns near stenotic lesions in the femoral trajectory may provide insight in progression of disease and improve its diagnosis and treatment. High-frame-rate contrast-enhanced ultrasound, or echo PIV, seems a promising technique in visualizing and quantifying local flow profiles. This thesis discusses the work that has been done in investigating the behavior of contrast agents used during echo PIV measurements (1) and presents the first assessment of clinical feasibility of echo PIV in patients recently treated with a stent in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) (2). Method (1) Microbubble behavior was investigated experimentally in a controlled flow set-up. US data were captured with increasing transmit voltage and number of pulse cycles during three different steady flow conditions. Data were analyzed in the frequency domain before and after manually applying pulse inversion (PI). (2) Clinical echo PIV measurements were performed at five different locations near the femoral bifurcation and the stented SFA in a pilot of twenty patients. Vessel visibility and contrast-to-background ratio (CBR) were evaluated as a measure of image quality. Accuracy of PIV was analyzed using the maximum normalized cross-correlation value and peak systolic velocity compared to duplex US. Results (1) Bubbles were visible in all measurements after PI was performed. In general, the intensity of the fundamental frequency was more present in the received signal from the microbubbles relative to the second harmonic frequency. Intensity of the fundamental frequency increased with increasing flow. (2) Echo PIV data of twelve patients was successfully acquired. Quality of the measurements showed varying results in terms of vessel visibility and CBR between and within patients. Data of one patient was further analyzed through PIV. In two out of five locations adequate PIV results were found, showing high cross-correlation values and a velocity difference within 10% compared to duplex US. Conclusion (1) Bubble visualization was accomplished based on decorrelation between the two acquisitions needed for PI due to motion of the microbubbles causing imperfect cancellation of the fundamental frequency. Methods to better utilize non-linear behavior of the contrast should be further investigated. (2) First assessment of echo PIV showed varying results which seem linked to the quality of the obtained data. Accurate blood flow velocity tracking was established in data with high CBR values. More data should be analyzed and improvements in PIV methods should be explored in order to draw a thorough conclusion regarding feasibility of echo PIV in quantifying blood flow in the femoral bifurcation and the stented SFA.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to compare the in vitro performance of two new Doppler techniques with pulsed wave Doppler (PW). Ultrafast color Doppler (UFCD), high-frame-rate vector flow (HiFR-VF), and PW methods were compared on a standardized phantom. The time-averaged maximum (TAmax) velocity measured by three different ultrasound systems was compared with the nominal values, namely 35, 70 and 106 cm/s, displayed by the phantom. The accuracy and precision in measuring different velocities were estimated for a continuously fully-developed flow in a 5 mm diameter straight tube. All the systems estimated TAmax with a relative bias between -10% and +20% with PW, mainly overestimating the expected velocity. The mean velocities and relative biases were significantly different in the three systems at almost all selected velocities (p<0.0001). However, the mean velocities and relative biases were not significantly different for UFCD and HiFR-VF methods at all velocities (p>0.36) and showed the same accuracy and precision (p>0.05). The HiFR-VF, UFCD and PW methods demonstrated an overall mean relative bias of -1.02%, 2.14% and -2.77%, respectively. The HiFR-VF technique resulted in more accurate and precise overall results. HiFR-VF and UFCD were more accurate and precise than PW in the TAmax assessments at various velocities. HiFR-VF showed better performance compared to PW and UFCD which are angle dependent. This may be due to HiFR-VF angle independence. The HiFR-VF findings were achieved with the plane wave multidirectional transmission and reception technique, employed to measure each velocity vector component, which may have affected the positive results.},

abstract = {Eulerian, ultrasound-based velocimetry has become a popular tool for evaluating non-optically accessible flows, and has demonstrated great potential for medical flows. In contrast, the current study presents a Lagrangian method of extracting path-dependent dynamics from time-resolved ultrasound images referred to here as echo-Lagrangian particle tracking (echoLPT). Ultrasound system parameters specific to Lagrangian tracking are detailed for recording pulsatile flow through an idealized stenosis model. Furthermore, seeding materials and image processing procedures are discussed in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio and minimize particle image ambiguity. The pathlines that result from echoLPT reveal mixing downstream of the stenosis, and yield time-resolved, path-dependent information. As a means to demonstrate the value of echoLPT, particle residence time (PRT) in the post-stenotic region is calculated. PRT is the length of time a fluid parcel remains within a region of interest, and is used to highlight the effects of pulsatility. For the pulsatile flows tested, PRT is shown to increase with the frequency of pulsation as fluid is swept into the recirculation region, while PRT is decreased with increasing mean Reynolds number and amplitude ratio.},

abstract = {Clinicians frequently study arterial Doppler velocimetric waveforms depicted by Doppler sonography of the kidneys, the heart, the brain, and the feto-maternal circulation to assess the well-being of the aforementioned vital organs. The waveform interpretation of the Doppler indices can be studied using a mathematical model. The developed models serve as teaching tools and for easy comprehension of the regulatory mechanism of the organs. It will also obtain accurate wall shear stress (WSS) and likely atherosclerotic sites can be predicted early. The aim of this review is to reveal the imperatives of mathematical models in the study of the physical interpretation of Doppler velocimetry. The models will explore sonographic Doppler velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in determining the segments of the arteries that are prone to the development of atheromatous plaque. It will be achieved by comparing and computing the measurement differences of the WSS. A thorough literature review was carried out between 1971 and 2021 on the mathematical modeling of blood dynamics and Doppler velocimetry of different blood vessels, across various electronic databases including NC AHEC Digital Library, PUBMED, ERIC, MEDLINE, Free Medical Journals, and EMBASE. The results of the literature search were presented using the PRISMA flow chat. The narrative review of the mathematical models of arterial blood dynamics is based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the Windkessel model, and CFD. It was deduced that the blood flow velocity decreased with time across the varying frequency from 0.2Hz to 0.50Hz in the interlobar arterial channels. The review also revealed that adult humans' Doppler indices of the renal-interlobar artery agree with developed models of renal interlobar arterial blood dynamics. The mathematical model measurements of the great vessels matched the sonographic Doppler velocimetry with <15% variation. In our fast-paced world of epidemiological transition, the imperatives of mathematical modeling of arterial flow dynamics based on the Navier–Stokes equations to represent various physiologic and pathologic situations cannot be overstated. The practical consequences include the possibility of mathematical models to acquire precise WSS distribution and early detection of potential atherosclerotic sites during cardiovascular Doppler sonography.},

abstract = {Ultrafast Doppler has been accepted as a novel modality for small vasculature imaging with high sensitivity, high spatiotemporal resolution, and high penetration. However, the conventional Doppler estimator adopted in studies of ultrafast ultrasound imaging is only sensitive to the velocity component along the beam direction and has angle-dependent limitations. Vector Doppler has been developed with the goal of angle-independent velocity estimation but is typically employed for relatively large vessels. In this study, combining multiangle vector Doppler strategy and ultrafast sequencing, ultrafast ultrasound vector Doppler (ultrafast UVD) is developed for small vasculature hemodynamic imaging. The validity of the technique is demonstrated through experiments on a rotational phantom, rat brain, human brain, and human spinal cord. A rat brain experiment shows that compared with the ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) velocimetry, which is widely accepted as an accurate flow velocimetry technique, the average relative error (ARE) of the velocity magnitude estimated by ultrafast UVD is approximately 16.2%, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the velocity direction of 26.7°. It is demonstrated that ultrafast UVD is a promising tool for accurate blood flow velocity measurement, especially for the organs, including brain and spinal cord with vasculature typically exhibiting tendential alignment of vascular trees.},
