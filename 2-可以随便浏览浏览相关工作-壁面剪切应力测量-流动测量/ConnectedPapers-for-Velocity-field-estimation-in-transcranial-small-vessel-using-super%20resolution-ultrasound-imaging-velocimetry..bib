abstract = {Coherent plane-wave compounding technique enables rapid ultrasound imaging with comparable image quality to traditional B-mode imaging that relies on focused beam transmission. However, existing methods assume homogeneity in the imaged medium, neglecting the heterogeneity in sound velocities and densities present in real tissues, resulting in noise reverberation. This study introduces the Reverse Time Migration (RTM) method for ultrasound plane-wave imaging to overcome this limitation, which is combined with a method for estimating the speed of sound in layered media. Simulation results in a homogeneous background demonstrate that RTM reduces side lobes and grating lobes by approximately 30 dB, enhancing the contrast-to-noise ratio by 20% compared to conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamforming. Moreover, RTM achieves superior imaging outcomes with fewer compounding angles. The lateral resolution of the RTM with 5–9 angle compounding is able to achieve the effectiveness of the DAS method with 15–19 angle compounding, and the CNR of the RTM with 11-angle compounding is almost the same as that of the DAS with 21-angle compounding. In a heterogeneous background, experimental simulations and in vitro wire phantom experiments confirm RTM's capability to correct depth imaging, focusing reflected waves on point targets. In vitro porcine tissue experiments enable accurate imaging of layer interfaces by estimating the velocities of multiple layers containing muscle and fat. The proposed imaging procedure optimizes velocity estimation in complex media, compensates for the impact of velocity differences, provides more reliable imaging results.},

abstract = {Background Variations in lymph node (LN) microcirculation can be indicative of metastasis. The identification and quantification of metastatic LNs remains essential for prognosis and treatment planning, but a reliable noninvasive imaging technique is lacking. Three-dimensional super-resolution (SR) US has shown potential to noninvasively visualize microvascular networks in vivo. Purpose To study the feasibility of three-dimensional SR US imaging of rabbit LN microvascular structure and blood flow by using microbubbles. Materials and Methods In vivo studies were carried out to image popliteal LNs of two healthy male New Zealand white rabbits aged 6-8 weeks. Three-dimensional, high-frame-rate, contrast material-enhanced US was achieved by mechanically scanning with a linear imaging probe. Individual microbubbles were identified, localized, and tracked to form three-dimensional SR images and super-resolved velocity maps. Acoustic subaperture processing was used to improve image contrast and to generate enhanced power Doppler and color Doppler images. Vessel size and blood flow velocity distributions were evaluated and assessed by using Student paired t test. Results SR images revealed microvessels in the rabbit LN, with branches clearly resolved when separated by 30 µm, which is less than half of the acoustic wavelength and not resolvable by using power or color Doppler. The apparent size distribution of most vessels in the SR images was below 80 µm and agrees with micro-CT data, whereas most of those detected with Doppler techniques were larger than 80 µm in the images. The blood flow velocity distribution indicated that most of the blood flow in rabbit popliteal LN was at velocities lower than 5 mm/sec. Conclusion Three-dimensional super-resolution US imaging using microbubbles allows noninvasive nonionizing visualization and quantification of lymph node microvascular structures and blood flow dynamics with resolution below the wave diffraction limit. This technology has potential for studying the physiologic functions of the lymph system and for clinical detection of lymph node metastasis. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy can map blood vessels with a resolution much smaller than the wavelength by localizing microbubbles. The current implementations of the technique are limited to 2-D planes or small fields of view in 3-D. These suffer from minutelong acquisitions, out-of-plane microbubbles, and tissue motion. In this paper, we exploit the recent development of 4D ultrafast ultrasound imaging to insonify an isotropic volume up to 20 000 times per second and perform localization microscopy in the three dimensions. Specifically, a 32 ×32 elements, 9-MHz matrix-array probe connected to a 1024-channel programmable ultrasound scanner was used to achieve sub-wavelength volumetric imaging of both the structure and vector flow of a complex 3D structure (a main canal branching out into two side canals). To cope with the large volumes and the need to localize the bubbles in the three dimensions, novel algorithms were developed based on deconvolution of the beamformed microbubble signal. For tracking, individual particles were paired following a Munkres assignment method, and velocimetry was done following a Lagrangian approach. ULM was able to clearly represent the 3-D shape of the structure with a sharp delineation of canal edges (as small as 230 μm) and separate them with a spacing as low as 52μm. The compounded volume rate of 500 Hz was sufficient to describe velocities in 2.5–150-mm/s range and to reduce the maximum acquisition time to 12 s. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of in vitro 3-D ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy and opens up the way toward in vivo volumetric ULM.},

abstract = {With the widespread interest and uptake of super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) through localization and tracking of microbubbles, also known as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), many localization and tracking algorithms have been developed. ULM can image many centimeters into tissue in-vivo and track microvascular flow non-invasively with sub-diffraction resolution. In a significant community effort, we organized a challenge, Ultrasound Localization and TRacking Algorithms for Super-Resolution (ULTRA-SR). The aims of this paper are threefold: to describe the challenge organization, data generation, and winning algorithms; to present the metrics and methods for evaluating challenge entrants; and to report results and findings of the evaluation. Realistic ultrasound datasets containing microvascular flow for different clinical ultrasound frequencies were simulated, using vascular flow physics, acoustic field simulation and nonlinear bubble dynamics simulation. Based on these datasets, 38 submissions from 24 research groups were evaluated against ground truth using an evaluation framework with six metrics, three for localization and three for tracking. In-vivo mouse brain and human lymph node data were also provided, and performance assessed by an expert panel. Winning algorithms are described and discussed. The publicly available data with ground truth and the defined metrics for both localization and tracking present a valuable resource for researchers to benchmark algorithms and software, identify optimized methods/software for their data, and provide insight into the current limits of the field. In conclusion, Ultra-SR challenge has provided benchmarking data and tools as well as direct comparison and insights for a number of the state-of-the art localization and tracking algorithms.},

abstract = {Motion during image acquisition can cause image degradation in all medical imaging modalities. This is particularly relevant in 2-D ultrasound imaging, since out-of-plane motion can only be compensated for movements smaller than elevational beamwidth of the transducer. Localization based super-resolution imaging creates even a more challenging motion correction task due to the requirement of a high number of acquisitions to form a single super-resolved frame. In this study, an extension of two-stage motion correction method is proposed for 3-D motion correction. Motion estimation was performed on high volumetric rate ultrasound acquisitions with a handheld probe. The capability of the proposed method was demonstrated with a 3-D microvascular flow simulation to compensate for handheld probe motion. Results showed that two-stage motion correction method reduced the average localization error from 136 to 18 μm.},

abstract = {In the last decade, Ultrafast ultrasound localisation microscopy has taken non-invasive deep vascular imaging down to the microscopic level. By imaging diluted suspensions of circulating microbubbles in the blood stream at kHz frame rate and localizing the center of their individual point spread function with a sub-resolution precision, it enabled to break the unvanquished trade-off between depth of imaging and resolution by microscopically mapping the microbubbles flux and velocities deep into tissue. However, ULM also suffers limitations. Many small vessels are not visible in the ULM images due to the noise level in areas dimly explored by the microbubbles. Moreover, as the vast majority of studies are performed using 2D imaging, quantification is limited to in-plane velocity or flux measurements which hinders the accurate velocity determination and quantification. Here we show that the backscattering amplitude of each individual microbubble can also be exploited to produce backscattering images of the vascularization with a higher sensitivity compared to conventional ULM images. By providing valuable information about the relative distance of the microbubble to the 2D imaging plane in the out-of-plane direction, backscattering ULM images introduces a physically relevant 3D rendering perception in the vascular maps. It also retrieves the missing information about the out-of-plane motion of microbubbles and provides a way to improve 3D flow and velocity quantification using 2D ULM. These results pave the way to improved visualization and quantification for 2D and 3D ULM.},

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging vascular imaging technique that overcomes the resolution-penetration compromise of ultrasound imaging. Accurate and robust microbubble (MB) localization is essential for successful ULM. In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)- based localization technique that uses both Field-II simulation and in vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) data for training. Both radiofrequency (RF) and in-phase quadrature (IQ) data were tested in this study. The simulation experiment shows that the proposed DL-based localization was able to reduce both missing MB localization rate and MB localization error. In general, RF data showed better performance than IQ. For the in vivo CAM study with high MB concentration, DL-based localization was able to reduce the vessel MB saturation time by more than 50% as compared to conventional localization. Additionally, we propose a DL-based framework for real-time visualization of the high-resolution microvasculature. The findings of the paper support the use of DL for more robust and faster MB localization, especially under high MB concentrations. The results indicate that further improvement could be achieved by incorporating temporal information of the MB data.},

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) has been proposed to image microvasculature beyond the ultrasound diffraction limit. Although ULM can attain microvascular images with a sub-diffraction resolution, long data acquisition time and processing time are the critical limitations. Deep learning-based ULM (deep-ULM) has been proposed to mitigate these limitations. However, microbubble (MB) localization used in deep-ULMs is currently based on spatial information without the use of temporal information. The highly spatiotemporally coherent MB signals provide a strong feature that can be used to differentiate MB signals from background artifacts. In this study, a deep neural network was employed and trained with spatiotemporal ultrasound datasets to better identify the MB signals by leveraging both the spatial and temporal information of the MB signals. Training, validation and testing datasets were acquired from MB suspension to mimic the realistic intensity-varying and moving MB signals. The performance of the proposed network was first demonstrated in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane dataset with an optical microscopic image as the reference standard. Substantial improvement in spatial resolution was shown for the reconstructed super-resolved images compared with power Doppler images. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of a microvessel was improved from 133 μm to 35 μm, which is smaller than the ultrasound wavelength (73 μm). The proposed method was further tested in an in vivo human liver data. Results showed the reconstructed super-resolved images could resolve a microvessel of nearly 170 μm (FWHM). Adjacent microvessels with a distance of 670 μm, which cannot be resolved with power Doppler imaging, can be well-separated with the proposed method. Improved contrast ratios using the proposed method were shown compared with that of the conventional deep-ULM method. Additionally, the processing time to reconstruct a high-resolution ultrasound frame with an image size of 1024 × 512 pixels was around 16 ms, comparable to state-of-the-art deep-ULMs.},

abstract = {Contrast microbubble (MB)-based super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging (SR-UMI) overcomes the compromise in conventional ultrasound imaging between spatial resolution and penetration depth and has been successfully applied to a wide range of clinical applications. However, clinical translation of SR-UMI remains challenging due to the limited number of MBs detected within a given accumulation time. Here, we propose a Kalman filter-based method for robust MB tracking and improved blood flow speed measurement with reduced numbers of MBs. An acceleration constraint and a direction constraint for MB movement were developed to control the quality of the estimated MB trajectory. An adaptive interpolation approach was developed to inpaint the missing microvessel signal based on the estimated local blood flow speed, facilitating more robust depiction of microvasculature with a limited amount of MBs. The proposed method was validated on an ex ovo chorioallantoic membrane and an in vivo rabbit kidney. Results demonstrated improved imaging performance on both microvessel density maps and blood flow speed maps. With the proposed method, the percentage of microvessel filling in a selected blood vessel at a given accumulation period was increased from 28.17% to 74.45%. A similar SR-UMI performance was achieved with MB numbers reduced by 85.96%, compared to that with the original MB number. The results indicate that the proposed method substantially improves the robustness of SR-UMI under a clinically relevant imaging scenario where SR-UMI is challenged by a limited MB accumulation time, reduced number of MBs, lowered imaging frame rate, and degraded signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy has enabled super-resolution vascular imaging through precise localization of individual ultrasound contrast agents (microbubbles) across numerous imaging frames. However, analysis of high-density regions with significant overlaps among the microbubble point spread responses yields high localization errors, constraining the technique to low-concentration conditions. As such, long acquisition times are required to sufficiently cover the vascular bed. In this work, we present a fast and precise method for obtaining super-resolution vascular images from high-density contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging data. This method, which we term Deep Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (Deep-ULM), exploits modern deep learning strategies and employs a convolutional neural network to perform localization microscopy in dense scenarios, learning the nonlinear image-domain implications of overlapping RF signals originating from such sets of closely spaced microbubbles. Deep-ULM is trained effectively using realistic on-line synthesized data, enabling robust inference in-vivo under a wide variety of imaging conditions. We show that deep learning attains super-resolution with challenging contrast-agent densities, both in-silico as well as in-vivo. Deep-ULM is suitable for real-time applications, resolving about 70 high-resolution patches ( $128\times 128$ pixels) per second on a standard PC. Exploiting GPU computation, this number increases to 1250 patches per second.},

abstract = {Ultrasound (US) localization microscopy offers new radiation-free diagnostic tools for vascular imaging deep within the tissue. Sequential localization of echoes returned from inert microbubbles (MBs) with low concentration within the bloodstream reveals the vasculature with capillary resolution. Despite its high spatial resolution, low MB concentrations dictate the acquisition of tens of thousands of images, over the course of several seconds to tens of seconds, to produce a single superresolved image. Such long acquisition times and stringent constraints on MB concentration are undesirable in many clinical scenarios. To address these restrictions, sparsity-based approaches have recently been developed. These methods reduce the total acquisition time dramatically, while maintaining good spatial resolution in settings with considerable MB overlap. Here, we further improve the spatial resolution and visual vascular reconstruction quality of sparsity-based superresolution US imaging from low-frame rate acquisitions, by exploiting the inherent flow of MBs and utilize their motion kinematics. We also provide quantitative measurements of MB velocities and show that our approach achieves higher MB recall rate than the state-of-the-art techniques, while increasing contrast agents concentration. Our method relies on simultaneous tracking and sparsity-based detection of individual MBs in a frame-by-frame manner, and as such, may be suitable for real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on both simulations and an in vivo contrast-enhanced human prostate scan, acquired with a clinically approved scanner operating at a 10-Hz frame rate.},

abstract = {Identifying and visualizing vasculature within organs and tumors has major implications in managing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound scans detect slow-flowing blood, facilitating noninvasive perfusion measurements. However, their limited spatial resolution prevents the depiction of microvascular structures. Recently, super-localization ultrasonography techniques have surpassed this limit. However, they require long acquisition times of several minutes, preventing the detection of hemodynamic changes. We present a fast super-resolution method that exploits sparsity in the underlying vasculature and statistical independence within the measured signals. Similar to super-localization techniques, this approach improves the spatial resolution by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard scans. Unlike super-localization methods, it requires acquisition times of only tens of milliseconds. We demonstrate a temporal resolution of ~25 Hz, which may enable functional super-resolution imaging deep within the tissue, surpassing the temporal resolution limitations of current super-resolution methods, e.g., in neural imaging. The subsecond acquisitions make our approach robust to motion artifacts, simplifying in vivo use of super-resolution ultrasound.},

This is particularly relevant in 2-D ultrasound imaging, since out-of-plane motion can only be compensated for movements smaller than elevational beamwidth of the transducer. Localization based super-resolution imaging creates even a more challenging motion correction task due to the requirement of a high number of acquisitions to form a single super-resolved frame. 
In this study, an extension of two-stage motion correction method is proposed for 3-D motion correction. Motion estimation was performed on high volumetric rate ultrasound acquisitions with a handheld probe. The capability of the proposed method was demonstrated with a 3-D microvascular flow simulation to compensate for handheld probe motion. Results showed that two-stage motion correction method reduced the average localization error from 136 to 18 micrometres.},

abstract = {A number of acoustic super-resolution techniques have recently been developed to visualize microvascular structure and flow beyond the diffraction limit. A crucial aspect of all ultrasound (US) super-resolution (SR) methods using single microbubble localization is time-efficient detection of individual bubble signals. Due to the need for bubbles to circulate through the vasculature during acquisition, slow flows associated with the microcirculation limit the minimum acquisition time needed to obtain adequate spatial information. Here, a model is developed to investigate the combined effects of imaging parameters, bubble signal density, and vascular flow on SR image acquisition time. We find that the estimated minimum time needed for SR increases for slower blood velocities and greater resolution improvement. To improve SR from a resolution of $\lambda $ /10 to $\lambda $ /20 while imaging the microvasculature structure modeled here, the estimated minimum acquisition time increases by a factor of 14. The maximum useful imaging frame rate to provide new spatial information in each image is set by the bubble velocity at low blood flows (<150 mm/s for a depth of 5 cm) and by the acoustic wave velocity at higher bubble velocities. Furthermore, the image acquisition procedure, transmit frequency, localization precision, and desired super-resolved image contrast together determine the optimal acquisition time achievable for fixed flow velocity. Exploring the effects of both system parameters and details of the target vasculature can allow a better choice of acquisition settings and provide improved understanding of the completeness of SR information.},

abstract = {Ultrasound super-resolution (SR) microvessel imaging technologies are rapidly emerging and evolving. The unprecedented combination of imaging resolution and penetration promises a wide range of preclinical and clinical applications. This paper concerns spatial quantization error in SR imaging, a common issue that involves a majority of current SR imaging methods. While quantization error can be alleviated by the microbubble localization process (e.g., via upsampling or parametric fitting), it is unclear to what extent the localization process can suppress the spatial quantization error induced by discrete sampling. It is also unclear when low spatial sampling frequency will result in irreversible quantization errors that cannot be suppressed by the localization process. This paper had two goals: 1) to systematically investigate the effect of quantization in SR imaging and establish principles of adequate SR imaging spatial sampling that yield minimal quantization error with proper localization methods and 2) to compare the performance of various localization methods and study the level of tolerance of each method to quantization. We conducted experiments on a small wire target and on a microbubble flow phantom. We found that the Fourier analysis of an oversampled spatial profile of the microbubble signal could provide reliable guidance for selecting beamforming spatial sampling frequency. Among various localization methods, parametric Gaussian fitting and centroid-based localization on upsampled data had better microbubble localization performance and were less susceptible to quantization error than peak intensity-based localization methods. When spatial sampling resolution was low, parametric Gaussian fitting-based localization had the best performance in suppressing quantization error, and could produce acceptable SR microvessel imaging with no significant quantization artifacts. The findings from this paper can be used in practice to help intelligently determine the minimum requirement of spatial sampling for robust microbubble localization to avoid adding or even reduce the burden of computational cost and data storage that are commonly associated with SR imaging.},

The current implementations of the technique are limited to 2-D planes or small fields of view in 3-D. These suffer from minute-long acquisitions, out-of-plane microbubbles, and tissue motion. In this paper, we exploit the recent development of 4D ultrafast ultrasound imaging to insonify an isotropic volume up to 20 000 times per second and perform localization microscopy in the three dimensions. Specifically, a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$32\,\,\times 32$ </tex-math></inline-formula> elements, 9-MHz matrix-array probe connected to a 1024-channel programmable ultrasound scanner was used to achieve sub-wavelength volumetric imaging of both the structure and vector flow of a complex 3D structure (a main canal branching out into two side canals). To cope with the large volumes and the need to localize the bubbles in the three dimensions, novel algorithms were developed based on deconvolution of the beamformed microbubble signal. For tracking, individual particles were paired following a Munkres assignment method, and velocimetry was done following a Lagrangian approach. ULM was able to clearly represent the 3-D shape of the structure with a sharp delineation of canal edges (as small as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$230~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and separate them with a spacing as low as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$52\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>.

abstract = {As in other imaging methods based on waves, the resolution of ultrasound imaging is limited by the wavelength. However, the diffraction-limit can be overcome by super-localizing single events from isolated sources. In recent years, we developed plane-wave ultrasound allowing frame rates up to 20 000 fps. Ultrafast processes such as rapid movement or disruption of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) can thus be monitored, providing us with distinct punctual sources that could be localized beyond the diffraction limit. We previously showed experimentally that resolutions beyond λ/10 can be reached in ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy (uULM) using a 128 transducer matrix in reception. Higher resolutions are theoretically achievable and the aim of this study is to predict the maximum resolution in uULM with respect to acquisition parameters (frequency, transducer geometry, sampling electronics). The accuracy of uULM is the error on the localization of a bubble, considered a point-source in a homogeneous medium. The proposed model consists in two steps: determining the timing accuracy of the microbubble echo in radiofrequency data, then transferring this time accuracy into spatial accuracy. The simplified model predicts a maximum resolution of 40 μm for a 1.75 MHz transducer matrix composed of two rows of 64 elements. Experimental confirmation of the model was performed by flowing microbubbles within a 60 μm microfluidic channel and localizing their blinking under ultrafast imaging (500 Hz frame rate). The experimental resolution, determined as the standard deviation in the positioning of the microbubbles, was predicted within 6 μm (13%) of the theoretical values and followed the analytical relationship with respect to the number of elements and depth. Understanding the underlying physical principles determining the resolution of superlocalization will allow the optimization of the imaging setup for each organ. Ultimately, accuracies better than the size of capillaries are achievable at several centimeter depths.},

abstract = {The structure of microvasculature cannot be resolved using conventional ultrasound (US) imaging due to the fundamental diffraction limit at clinical US frequencies. It is possible to overcome this resolution limitation by localizing individual microbubbles through multiple frames and forming a superresolved image, which usually requires seconds to minutes of acquisition. Over this time interval, motion is inevitable and tissue movement is typically a combination of large- and small-scale tissue translation and deformation. Therefore, super-resolution (SR) imaging is prone to motion artifacts as other imaging modalities based on multiple acquisitions are. This paper investigates the feasibility of a two-stage motion estimation method, which is a combination of affine and nonrigid estimation, for SR US imaging. First, the motion correction accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations with increasing complexity of motion. A mean absolute error of 12.2  $\mu \text{m}$  was achieved in simulations for the worst-case scenario. The motion correction algorithm was then applied to a clinical data set to demonstrate its potential to enable in vivo SR US imaging in the presence of patient motion. The size of the identified microvessels from the clinical SR images was measured to assess the feasibility of the two-stage motion correction method, which reduced the width of the motion-blurred microvessels to approximately 1.5-fold.},

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a vascular imaging method that provides a 10-fold improvement in resolution compared to ultrasound Doppler imaging. Because typical ULM acquisitions accumulate large numbers of synthetic microbubble (MB) trajectories over hundreds of cardiac cycles, transient hemodynamic variations such as pulsatility get averaged out. Here we introduce two independent processing methods to retrieve pulsatile flow characteristics from MB trajectories sampled at kilohertz frame rates and demonstrate their potential on a simulated dataset. The first approach follows a Lagrangian description of the flow. We filter the MB trajectories to eliminate ULM localization grid artifacts and successfully recover the pulsatility fraction <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$P_{\mathrm {f}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.3%. Our second approach follows a Eulerian description of the flow. It relies on the accumulation of MB velocity estimates as observed from a stationary observer. We show that pulsatile flow gives rise to a bimodal velocity distribution with peaks indicating the maximum and minimum velocities of the cardiac cycle. In this second method, we recovered the pulsatility fraction <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$P_{\mathrm {f}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> by measuring the location of these distribution peaks with a RMSE of 5.2%. We evaluated the impact of the MB localization precision <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sigma $ </tex-math></inline-formula> on our ability to retrieve the bimodal signature of a pulsatile flow. Together, our results demonstrate that pulsatility can be retrieved from ULM acquisitions at kilohertz frame rate and that the estimation of the pulsatility fraction improves with localization precision.},

abstract = {Super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging with contrast microbubbles has recently been proposed by multiple studies, demonstrating outstanding resolution with high potential for clinical applications. This paper aims at addressing the potential noise issue in <italic>in vivo</italic> human super-resolution imaging with ultrafast plane-wave imaging. The rich spatiotemporal information provided by ultrafast imaging presents features that allow microbubble signals to be separated from background noise. In addition, the high-frame-rate recording of microbubble data enables the implementation of robust tracking algorithms commonly used in particle tracking velocimetry. In this paper, we applied the nonlocal means (NLM) denoising filter on the spatiotemporal domain of the microbubble data to preserve the microbubble tracks caused by microbubble movement and suppress random background noise. We then implemented a bipartite graph-based pairing method with the use of persistence control to further improve the microbubble signal quality and microbubble tracking fidelity. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> rabbit kidney perfusion study, the NLM filter showed effective noise rejection and substantially improved microbubble localization. The bipartite graph pairing and persistence control demonstrated further noise reduction, improved microvessel delineation, and a more consistent microvessel blood flow speed measurement. With the proposed methods and freehand scanning on a free-breathing rabbit, a single microvessel cross-sectional profile with full-width at half-maximum of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$57~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> could be imaged at approximately 2-cm depth (ultrasound transmit center frequency = 8 MHz, theoretical spatial resolution <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sim 200~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Cortical microvessels that are <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$76~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> apart can also be clearly separated. These results suggest that the proposed methods have good potential in facilitating robust <italic>in vivo</italic> clinical super-resolution microvessel imaging.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis has been known as a hallmark of solid tumor cancers for decades, yet ultrasound has been limited in its ability to detect the microvascular changes associated with malignancy. Here, we demonstrate the potential of 'ultrasound localization microscopy' applied volumetrically in combination with quantitative analysis of microvascular morphology, as an approach to overcome this limitation. This pilot study demonstrates our ability to image complex microvascular patterns associated with tumor angiogenesis in-vivo at a resolution of tens of microns - substantially better than the diffraction limit of traditional clinical ultrasound, yet using an 8 MHz clinical ultrasound probe. Furthermore, it is observed that data from healthy and tumor-bearing tissue exhibit significant differences in microvascular pattern and density. Results suggests that with continued development of these novel technologies, ultrasound has the potential to detect biomarkers of cancer based on the microvascular 'fingerprint' of malignant angiogenesis rather than through imaging of blood flow dynamics or the tumor mass itself.},

abstract = {Because it drives the compromise between resolution and penetration, the diffraction limit has long represented an unreachable summit to conquer in ultrasound imaging. Within a few years after the introduction of optical localization microscopy, we proposed its acoustic alter ego that exploits the micrometric localization of microbubble contrast agents to reconstruct the finest vessels in the body in-depth. Various groups now working on the subject are optimizing the localization precision, microbubble separation, acquisition time, tracking, and velocimetry to improve the capacity of ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) to detect and distinguish vessels much smaller than the wavelength. It has since been used in vivo in the brain, the kidney, and tumors. In the clinic, ULM is bound to improve drastically our vision of the microvasculature, which could revolutionize the diagnosis of cancer, arteriosclerosis, stroke, and diabetes.},

abstract = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) demonstrates great potential for visualization of tissue microvasculature at depth with high spatial resolution. The success of ULM heavily depends on the robust localization of isolated microbubbles (MBs), which can be challenging in vivo especially within larger vessels where MBs can overlap and cluster close together. While MB dilution alleviates the issue of MB overlap to a certain extent, it drastically increases the data acquisition time needed for MBs to populate the microvasculature, which is already on the order of several minutes using recommended MB concentrations. Inspired by optical super-resolution imaging based on stimulated emission depletion (STED), here we propose a novel ULM imaging sequence based on microbubble uncoupling via transmit excitation (MUTE). MUTE “silences” MB signals by creating acoustic nulls to facilitate MB separation, which leads to robust localization of MBs especially under high concentrations. The efficiency of localization accomplished via the proposed technique was first evaluated in simulation studies with conventional ULM as a benchmark. Then an in vivo study based on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos showed that MUTE could reduce the data acquisition time by half thanks to the enhanced MB separation and localization. Finally, the performance of MUTE was validated in an in vivo mouse brain study. These results demonstrate the high MB localization efficacy of MUTE-ULM, which contributes to a reduced data acquisition time and improved temporal resolution for ULM.},

abstract = {Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) can resolve the microvascular bed down to a few micrometers. To achieve such performance, microbubble contrast agents must perfuse the entire microvascular network. Microbubbles are then located individually and tracked over time to sample individual vessels, typically over hundreds of thousands of images. To overcome the fundamental limit of diffraction and achieve a dense reconstruction of the network, low microbubble concentrations must be used, which leads to acquisitions lasting several minutes. Conventional processing pipelines are currently unable to deal with interference from multiple nearby microbubbles, further reducing achievable concentrations. This work overcomes this problem by proposing a Deep Learning approach to recover dense vascular networks from ultrasound acquisitions with high microbubble concentrations. A realistic mouse brain microvascular network, segmented from 2-photon microscopy, was used to train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a V-net architecture. Ultrasound data sets from multiple microbubbles flowing through the microvascular network were simulated and used as ground truth to train the 3D CNN to track microbubbles. The 3D-CNN approach was validated in silico using a subset of the data and in vivo in a rat brain. In silico, the CNN reconstructed vascular networks with higher precision (81%) than a conventional ULM framework (70%). In vivo, the CNN could resolve micro vessels as small as 10 $ {\mu}$ m with an improvement in resolution when compared against a conventional approach.},
