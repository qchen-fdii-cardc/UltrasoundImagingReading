abstract = {Two-dimensional blood velocity estimation has shown potential to solve the angle-dependency of conventional ultrasound flow imaging. Clutter filtering, however, remains a major challenge for large beam-to-flow angles, leading to signal drop-outs and corrupted velocity estimates. This work presents and evaluates a compounding speckle tracking (ST) algorithm to obtain robust angle-independent 2-D blood velocity estimates for all beam-to-flow angles. A dual-angle plane wave imaging setup with full parallel receive beamforming is utilized to achieve high-frame-rate speckle tracking estimates from two scan angles, which may be compounded to obtain velocity estimates of increased robustness. The acquisition also allows direct comparison with vector Doppler (VD) imaging. Absolute velocity bias and root-mean-square (RMS) error of the compounding ST estimations were investigated using simulations of a rotating flow phantom with low velocities ranging from 0 to 20 cm/s. In a challenging region where the estimates were influenced by clutter filtering, the bias and RMS error for the compounding ST estimates were 11% and 2 cm/s, a significant reduction compared with conventional single-angle ST (22% and 4 cm/s) and VD (36% and 6 cm/s). The method was also tested in vivo for vascular and neonatal cardiac imaging. In a carotid artery bifurcation, the obtained blood velocity estimates showed that the compounded ST method was less influenced by clutter filtering than conventional ST and VD methods. In the cardiac case, it was observed that ST velocity estimation is more affected by low signal-to-noise (SNR) than VD. However, with sufficient SNR the in vivo results indicated that a more robust angle-independent blood velocity estimator is obtained using compounded speckle tracking compared with conventional ST and VD methods.},

A major drawback of the method is the relatively limited dynamic range when conventional echography equipment is used. We present a method by which the restriction of the maximum flow rates can be relaxed, while still retaining the full field-of-view. The method uses conventional hardware, but a novel read-out sequence that interleaves subsequent images. By varying the offset between two interleaved images, we re-introduce the inter-frame time as a parameter that can be optimized for velocimetry.

abstract = {In atherosclerosis, low wall shear stress (WSS) is known to favor plaque development, while high WSS increases plaque rupture risk. To improve plaque diagnostics, WSS monitoring is crucial. Here, we propose wall shear imaging (WASHI), a noninvasive contrast-free framework that leverages high-frame-rate ultrasound (HiFRUS) to map the wall shear rate (WSR) that relates to WSS by the blood viscosity coefficient. Our method measures WSR as the tangential flow velocity gradient along the arterial wall from the flow vector field derived using a multi-angle vector Doppler technique. To improve the WSR estimation performance, WASHI semiautomatically tracks the wall position throughout the cardiac cycle. WASHI was first evaluated with an in vitro linear WSR gradient model; the estimated WSR was consistent with theoretical values (an average error of 4.6% $\pm ~12.4$ %). The framework was then tested on healthy and diseased carotid bifurcation models. In both scenarios, key spatiotemporal dynamics of WSR were noted: 1) oscillating shear patterns were present in the carotid bulb and downstream to the internal carotid artery (ICA) where retrograde flow occurs; and 2) high WSR was observed particularly in the diseased model where the measured WSR peaked at 810 $\text{s}^{-{1}}$ due to flow jetting. We also showed that WASHI could consistently track arterial wall motion to map its WSR. Overall, WASHI enables high temporal resolution mapping of WSR that could facilitate investigations on causal effects between WSS and atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Being able to measure 3-D flow velocity and volumetric flow rate effectively in the cardiovascular system is valuable but remains a significant challenge in both clinical practice and research. Currently, there has not been an effective and practical solution to the measurement of volume flow using ultrasound imaging systems due to challenges in existing 3-D imaging techniques and high system cost. In this study, a new technique for quantifying volumetric flow rate from the cross-sectional imaging plane of the blood vessel was developed by using speckle decorrelation (SDC), 2-D high-frame-rate imaging with a standard 1-D array transducer, microbubble contrast agents, and ultrasound imaging velocimetry (UIV). Through SDC analysis of microbubble signals acquired with a very high frame rate and by using UIV to estimate the two in-plane flow velocity components, the third and out-of-plane velocity component can be obtained over time and integrated to estimate volume flow. The proposed technique was evaluated on a wall-less flow phantom in both steady and pulsatile flow. UIV in the longitudinal direction was conducted as a reference. The influences of frame rate, mechanical index (MI), orientation of imaging plane, and compounding on velocity estimation were also studied. In addition, an in vivo trial on the abdominal aorta of a rabbit was conducted. The results show that the new system can estimate volume flow with an averaged error of 3.65% ± 2.37% at a flow rate of 360 mL/min and a peak velocity of 0.45 m/s, and an error of 5.03% ± 2.73% at a flow rate of 723 mL/min and a peak velocity of 0.8 m/s. The accuracy of the flow velocity and volumetric flow rate estimation directly depend on the imaging frame rate. With a frame rate of 6000 Hz, a velocity up to 0.8 m/s can be correctly estimated. A higher mechanical index (MI = 0.42) is shown to produce greater errors (up to 21.78±0.49%, compared to 3.65±2.37% at MI = 0.19). An in vivo trial, where velocities up to 1 m/s were correctly measured, demonstrated the potential of the technique in clinical applications.},

abstract = {Wall shear stress (WSS) is a crucial hemodynamic factor that promotes atherosclerosis (plaque) development in arteries; although the relationship between WSS and arterial atherosclerosis has been explored in many animal studies, it is not fully understood. No suitable tool, however, exists for rapidly estimating dynamic WSS in small-animal studies. This study proposes a 40-MHz high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) imaging system for dynamic WSS estimation based on mouse carotid artery blood flow velocity gradient measurements by vector Doppler imaging (VDI). Aliasing reduces the accuracy of Doppler measurements, which can be prevented by increasing the imaging frame rate. Conventionally, imaging is performed at two tilted angles by alternating between the angles; in the proposed method, the frame rate was doubled by imaging at each tilted angle sequentially and by then temporally aligning the sequences based on pulsatile flow characteristics. Velocity estimation using this method had low errors for both a steady-flow straight-tube and pulsatile flow 60%-stenosis phantom. The method was tested for wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice at 16 weeks old and apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice at 16 and 24 weeks old; differences in time-averaged and oscillatory WSS were observed, and histology confirmed that the 24-week ApoE KO mice with the highest oscillatory WSS had the greatest plaque formation. The proposed HFUS WSS imaging method can predict the location and extent of plaque development; thus, this method is useful for small-animal studies investigating the WSS effect on atherosclerotic plaque development.},

abstract = {Treatment of abdominal aortic (AA) aneurysms and stenotic lesions may be improved by analyzing their associated blood-flow patterns. Angle-independent blood-flow patterns in the AA can be obtained by combining echo-particle image velocimetry (ePIV) with high-frame-rate (HFR) contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. However, ePIV performance is affected by ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) concentration, microbubble stability, and tissue clutter. In this study, we assessed the influence of acoustic pressure and UCA concentration on image quality for ePIV analysis. We also compared amplitude modulation (AM) and singular value decomposition (SVD) as tissue suppression strategies for ePIV. Fourteen healthy volunteers were imaged in the region of the distal AA. We tested four different UCA bolus volumes (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5 mL) and four different acoustic output pressures (mechanical indices: 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09). As image quality metrics, we measured contrast-to-background ratio, bubble disruption ratio, and maximum normalized cross-correlation value during ePIV. At mechanical indices ≥ 0.06, we detected severe bubble destruction, suggesting that very low acoustic pressures should be used for ePIV. SVD was able to suppress tissue clutter better than AM. The maximum tracking correlation was affected by both UCA concentration and flow rate, where at high flow rates, lower UCA concentrations resulted in slightly higher correlation values but more signal drop-outs during late diastole. HFR ePIV was successfully performed in the AA of healthy volunteers and shows promise for future studies in patients.},

abstract = {The estimation of 3-D blood ow through vessels represents one of the most challenging aspects both in clinics and in research. Through the measurement of the volume ow it is possible to prevent many cardiovascular diseases, which are among the main causes of deaths all over the world. Currently, because of the limitations existing in the modern ultrasound systems, there is no e cient solution to estimate the volume ow. In recent years an interesting approach, capable to evaluate the volumetric blood ow from the cross-sectional imaging plane was conceived. This approach is based on detecting the outof-plane velocity component by using the speckle decorrelation (SDC) and the in-plane velocity components by using the ultrasound imaging velocimetry (UIV). By making use of micro-bubbles contrast agents and a standard 1-D array transducer working at high frame-rate, the recent research has found compelling results. Despite the good results, the new technique performs well only in presence of micro-bubbles contrast agents, which are necessary to enhance the blood ow signal. Therefore, this master thesis project aims to test the goodness of the speckle decorrelation method in absence of micro-bubbles. Since blood is anechoic, meaning that it produces weak echoes when hit by ultrasound, it is necessary to nd a way to increase its signal. Singular value decomposition (SVD) ltering has been performed to achieve this result. The proposed method has been evaluated on wall-less ow phantom, with the help of a pulsatile pump, which emulates the heartbeat. The phantom size is close to the one of big human vessels. In vitro experiments have been conducted with the use of the blood mimicking uid (BMF), which is able to mimic the characteristics of human blood. The in uence of di erent combinations of voltage and pulse length on the estimation of the velocity has been studied, as well. The conducted experiments show interesting results. In particular, it has been proved that at a ow rate of 80 mL/min and with low values of pulse length, i.e. PL=1 and PL=2, the estimated volume ow matches well with the ground-truth, providing an averaged error of 3.90% ± 2.43%. On the other side, the results obtained with high value of pulse length, i.e. PL=4 and PL=6, provided an averaged error of 16.01% ± 7.91%. The in vitro trials suggest that the technique studied in this master thesis project could give an important contribution in the next future clinical applications.},

abstract = {Designing robust Doppler vector estimation strategies for use in plane-wave imaging schemes based on unfocused transmissions is a topic that has yet to be studied in depth. One potential solution is to use a multi-angle Doppler estimation approach that computes flow vectors via least-squares fitting, but its performance has not been established. Here, we investigated the efficacy of multi-angle Doppler vector estimators by: 1) comparing its performance with respect to the classical dual-angle (cross-beam) Doppler vector estimator and 2) examining the working effects of multi-angle Doppler vector estimators on flow visualization quality in the context of dynamic flow path rendering. Implementing Doppler vector estimators that use different combinations of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) steering angles, our analysis has compared the classical dual-angle Doppler method, a 5-Tx version of dual-angle Doppler, and various multi-angle Doppler configurations based on 3 Tx and 5 Tx. Two angle spans (10°, 20°) were examined in forming the steering angles. In imaging scenarios with known flow profiles (rotating disk and straight-tube parabolic flow), the 3-Tx, 3-Rx and 5-Tx, 5-Rx multi-angle configurations produced vector estimates with smaller variability compared with the dual-angle method, and the estimation results were more consistent with the use of a 20° angle span. Flow vectors derived from multi-angle Doppler estimators were also found to be effective in rendering the expected flow paths in both rotating disk and straight-tube imaging scenarios, while the ones derived from the dual-angle estimator yielded flow paths that deviated from the expected course. These results serve to attest that using multi-angle least-squares Doppler vector estimators, flow visualization can be consistently achieved.},

abstract = {Blood velocity measurements are important in physiological science and clinical diagnosis. Doppler ultrasound is the most commonly used method but can only measure one velocity component. Ultrasound imaging velocimetry (UIV) is a promising technique capable of measuring two velocity components; however, there is a limit on the maximum velocity that can be measured with conventional hardware which results from the way images are acquired by sweeping the ultrasound beam across the field of view. Interleaved UIV is an extension of UIV in which two image frames are acquired concurrently, allowing the effective interframe separation time to be reduced and therefore increasing the maximum velocity that can be measured. The sweeping of the ultrasound beam across the image results in a systematic error which must be corrected: in this work, we derived and implemented a new velocity correction method which accounts for acceleration of the scatterers. We then, for the first time, assessed the performance of interleaved UIV for measuring pulsatile arterial velocities by measuring flows in phantoms and in vivo and comparing the results with spectral Doppler ultrasound and transit-time flow probe data. The velocity and flow rate in the phantom agreed within 5–10% of peak velocity, and 2–9% of peak flow, respectively, and in vivo the velocity difference was 9% of peak velocity. The maximum velocity measured was 1.8 m s−1, the highest velocity reported with UIV. This will allow flows in diseased arteries to be investigated and so has the potential to increase diagnostic accuracy and enable new vascular research.},

abstract = {This study investigated the use of ultrasound speckle decorrelation‐ and correlation‐based lateral speckle‐tracking methods for transverse and longitudinal blood velocity profile measurement, respectively. By studying the blood velocity gradient at the vessel wall, vascular wall shear stress, which is important in vascular physiology as well as the pathophysiologic mechanisms of vascular diseases, can be obtained. Decorrelation‐based blood velocity profile measurement transverse to the flow direction is a novel approach, which provides advantages for vascular wall shear stress measurement over longitudinal blood velocity measurement methods. Blood flow velocity profiles are obtained from measurements of frame‐to‐frame decorrelation. In this research, both decorrelation and lateral speckle‐tracking flow estimation methods were compared with Poiseuille theory over physiologic flows ranging from 50 to 1000 mm/s. The decorrelation flow velocity measurement method demonstrated more accurate prediction of the flow velocity gradient at the wall edge than the correlation‐based lateral speckle‐tracking method. The novelty of this study is that speckle decorrelation‐based flow velocity measurements determine the blood velocity across a vessel. In addition, speckle decor‐relation‐based flow velocity measurements have higher axial spatial resolution than Doppler ultrasound measurements to enable more accurate measurement of blood velocity near a vessel wall and determine the physiologically important wall shear.},

abstract = {A Bioeng Londo Abstract—There is increasing recognition of the influence of the flow field on the physiology of blood vessels and their development of pathology. Preliminary work is reported on a novel non-invasive technique, microbubble void imaging, which is based on ultrasound and controlled destruction of microbubble contrast agents, permitting flow visualisation and quantification of flow-induced mixing in large vessels. The generation of microbubble voids can be controlled both spatially and temporally using ultrasound parameters within the safety limits. Three different model vessel geometries—straight, planar-curved and helical—with known effects on the flow field and mixing were chosen to evaluate the technique. A high-frame-rate ultrasound system with plane wave transmission was used to acquire the contrast-enhanced ultrasound images, and an entropy measure was calculated to quantify mixing. The experimental results were cross-compared between the different geometries and with computational fluid dynamics. The results indicated that the technique is able to quantify the degree of mixing within the different configurations, with a helical geometry generating the greatest mixing, and a straight geometry, the lowest. There is a high level of concordance between the computational fluid dynamics and experimental results. The technique could also serve as a flow visualisation tool.

abstract = {A quantitative angle-independent 2-D modality for flow and tissue imaging based on multi-angle plane wave acquisition was evaluated. Simulations of realistic flow in a carotid artery bifurcation were used to assess the accuracy of the vector Doppler (VD) technique. Reduction in root mean square deviation from 27 cm/s to 6 cm/s and 7 cm/s to 2 cm/s was found for the lateral (vx) and axial (vz) velocity components, respectively, when the ensemble size was increased from 8 to 50. Simulations of a Couette flow phantom (vmax = 2.7 cm/s) gave promising results for imaging of slowly moving tissue, with root mean square deviation of 4.4 mm/s and 1.6 mm/s for the x- and z-components, respectively. A packet acquisition scheme providing both B-mode and vector Doppler RF data was implemented on a research scanner, and beamforming and further post-processing was done offline. In vivo results of healthy volunteers were in accordance with simulations and gave promising results for flow and tissue vector velocity imaging. The technique was also tested in patients with carotid artery disease. Using the high ensemble vector Doppler technique, blood flow through stenoses and secondary flow patterns were better visualized than in ordinary color Doppler. Additionally, the full velocity spectrum could be obtained retrospectively for arbitrary points in the image.},

However, the real-time implementation in US scanners is heavily hampered by the high calculation power required. In this work, we report a real-time vector Doppler imaging method which has been integrated in an open research system. The proposed approach exploits the plane waves transmitted from two sub-arrays of a linear probe to estimate the velocity vectors in 512 sample volumes aligned along the probe axis. The method has been tested for accuracy and reproducibility through simulations and in vitro experiments. Simulations over a 0° to 90° angle range of a 0.5 m/s peak parabolic flow have yielded 0.75° bias and 1.1° standard deviation for direction measurement, and 0.6 cm/s bias with 3.1% coefficient of variation for velocity assessment. In vitro tests have supported the simulation results. Preliminary measurements on the carotid artery of a volunteer have highlighted the real-time system capability of imaging complex flow configurations in an intuitive, easy, and quick way, as shown in a sample supplementary movie. These features have allowed reproducible peak velocity measurements to be obtained, as needed for quantitative investigations on patients.},

abstract = {High-frame-rate ultrasound imaging using diverging waves has demonstrated its potential as a useful cardiac imaging method. It has been shown that the compounding of steered beams improves static images quality. In the presence of high-velocity tissue motion, however, the combination of successive steered diverging waves is incoherent and thus deteriorates the image contrast. Motion compensation (MoCo) integrated in the coherent compounding process has recently shown to be a very promising technique to provide high-contrast B-mode images of the cardiac muscle. Ultrafast cardiac motion estimation based on speckle tracking could greatly benefit from this original method. In this study, Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) was applied on high-frame-rate envelope images performed with MoCo to estimate the myocardium 2-D motion. The method was investigated in vitro, using a rotating disk. With sequences of steered diverging waves (pulse repetition frequency = 4500 Hz) generated by the full aperture of a 2.5 MHz phased array, high-contrast high-resolution images were constructed at 500 FPS using MoCo. Standard cross-correlation and phase correlation in the Fourier domain were applied to generate VVI on the pre-scanned envelope images at 100 images/s. The estimated in vitro velocity vectors were consistent with the expected values, with an average normalized error of 6.0% +/-0.4% in the radial direction, and 13.1% +/-1.2% in the cross-range direction. These results make us confident to pursue the study with in vivo investigations.},
