abstract = {The ultrasonic flow meter is a newcomer among flow meters for measuring large quantities of natural gas. It has notable advantages compared to traditional meters. The ultrasonic flow meter is much more compact and has a wider dynamic range for flow measurements than the orifice plate meter. When manufactured, the ultrasonic sensors are often set back from the pipe wall in a cavity. When the fluid flows past the cavities, a secondary flow of vortices with characteristic size equal to the cavity width is established inside the cavities. The aim of this study has been to investigate the influence of this secondary flow on the accuracy of the ultrasonic flow meter. Both measurements and numerical simulations of the cavity flow have been conducted. It has been found from the present work, that the influence of the flow in the cavities on the measurements increases nonlinearly with the pipe flow rate.},

However, its applicability is still dragged by the difficulties to describe and scale the systematic errors resulted from uncertainty of firmware size, delay of circuits, propagation of ultrasonic, and etc. Therefore, calibration of TM-UFM is one of the complications to obtain accurate measurement, except for precise transit-time detection and improved transducers and circuits. This paper proposes a novel data fusion method for TM-UFM calibration based on particle swarm optimized (PSO) support vector machines (SVM). The parameters of SVM are optimized via PSO method to dissect sources of systematic errors. Besides, extensive experiments have been conducted on a platform of TM-UFM, and the results have illustrated the effectiveness of this method. The PSO-SVM based model leads to a decrease of systematic deviations from ±2% to ±1% (full scale) and improvement of the precision of the TM-UFM, compared with the Gauss-Legendre weight integration method.},

abstract = {As a widely used method in flow measurement, Gaussian quadrature is traditionally applied to determine the flowrate with multiple acoustic paths. However, it is only available to parallel path arrangement and the path position cannot be customized by users because of the nature of numerical integration principle. Accuracy of flowrate determination is greatly restricted meanwhile. In this paper, a new method based on generalized inverse of matrix (GIM) is proposed to work out the flowrate in arbitrary multipath arrangement. With an integrable model of flow distribution established, the GIM method will find the optimal weights and achieve highly accurate flowrate. Three perfect profile assumptions, including Jacobi, optimal weighted integration for circular sections, and typical power-law profile, are, respectively, adopted in this paper to explore the performance of GIM. Its effects are at first experimentally validated in parallel path arrangement of Gauss–Jacobi on a commercially available ultrasonic flowmeter. Then, four representative types that Gaussian quadrature is not feasible to are studied via numerical simulation, including a parallel and three crossed path arrangements. Performance of the proposed GIM method is verified under straight pipe, single bend, and double bend with an expander as well as on eight installation angles. Results reveal that GIM is applicable to accurate flowrate determination for arbitrary multipath arrangement and crossed paths could provide high determination accuracy and good robustness even under complicated flow field.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to experimentally determine and evaluate the value of the correction factor for ultrasonic flow meters in order to improve their accuracy. This article concerns flow velocity measurement with the use of an ultrasonic flow meter in the area of disturbed flow behind the distorting element. Clamp-on ultrasonic flow meters are popular among measurement technologies due to their high accuracy and easy, non-invasive installation, because the sensors are mounted directly on the outer surface of the pipe. In industrial applications, installation space is usually limited and, therefore, flow meters frequently have to be mounted directly behind flow disturbances. In such cases, it is necessary to determine the value of the correction factor. The disturbing element was a knife gate valve, a valve often used in flow installations. Water flow velocity tests were performed using an ultrasonic flow meter with clamp-on sensors on the pipeline. The research was performed in 2 series of measurements with different Reynolds numbers of 35,000 and 70,000, which correspond to a velocity of approximately 0.9 m/s and 1.8 m/s. The tests were carried out at different distances from the source of interference, within the range of 3–15 DN (pipe nominal diameter). The position of the sensors at successive measurement points on the circuit of the pipeline was changed by 30 degrees. Flow velocity measurements were carried out for two different levels of the valve’s closure: 1/3 and 1/2 of the valve’s height. For the collected velocity values at single measurement points, the values of the correction coefficient, K, were determined. The results of the tests and calculations prove that compensation error of measurement performed behind the disturbance without keeping the required straight sections of the pipeline is possible by using the factor K*. The analysis of the results made it possible to identify the optimal measuring point at a distance from the knife gate valve as being smaller than specified in the standards and recommendations.},

abstract = {Transit-time multipath ultrasonic flow meters (TM-UFMs) have been widely employed for measuring flowrate of gas and liquid. However, its applicability is still dragged by the difficulties to describe the physical model by precise mathematical expressions and to reduce the deviations led by the simplified principle models. Besides, fault-tolerance, including fault diagnosis and measure maintaining method, namely, rectification, is of great value in practical engineering, but there are few effective methods provided ever since to provide a solution for faulty UFMs. Therefore, data integration for TM-UFMs is one of the complications to obtain the accurate measurements, except for precise transit-time detection and improved transducers and circuits. This paper proposes a novel data integration method for TM-UFM calibration, as well as fault diagnosis and rectification based on particle swarm optimized support vector machines (PSO-SVM). Besides, extensive experiments have been conducted on a platform of TM-UFMs, and the results have illustrated the effectiveness of this method. The PSO-SVM-based models trained by the proposed method lead to a decrease of deviations to ±1% (full scale) in normal state for data integration, compared with ±2% deviations when a traditional method is adopted. When there exist one or two dysfunctional acoustic paths, the method diagnoses the faulty paths and maintains the measurement with deviations below ±2%.},

A numerical model based on large eddy simulation (LES) is developed here to study the features of turbulent errors in a typical U-shaped ultrasonic flowmeter. According to the flow structures obtained by LES, a one-dimensional turbulent spectrum and probability density function of helicity along the effective ultrasonic propagation path are calculated. It can be seen that the turbulent error is dominated by the large-scale anisotropic vortices in a specific range on the sampling line, and the anisotropic vortices have the common largest fluctuating scales in the error-dominated area in which the Reynolds number (Re) exceeds 15,000. The results provide possibilities for reducing the turbulent error by limiting the largest fluctuating scale through structure optimization. The probability density function of streamwise helicity is first introduced to unveil the continuous turbulent development in an ultrasonic flowmeter, which has the potential to contribute to turbulent analyses.},

They are based on a heat transfer measurement from a heated sensor into the fluid and provide precise mass flow measurements independent of the gas pressure. A critical issue for thermal mass flow sensors is the formation of coatings on the sensor head as they often occur in harsh environments. A coating will change the thermal properties of the sensor and will thus strongly influence the flow measurement. An accurate and stable measurement is therefore difficult to provide under harsh conditions. In this study possibilities are thus investigated to detect the presence of coatings on the sensor head by using a dual temperature sensor setup. Here the thermal behavior of the sensor is investigated and models are derived for describing the sensor and the influence of coatings. Based on these models algorithms are developed to provide coating diagnostics for thermal mass flow sensors.},

abstract = {The subject matter of the article concerns velocities/flow rate measurements in the area of disturbed flows-behind the 90° bend. They were conducted by means of an ultrasonic flowmeter with clamp-on sensors on pipeline, for water and two different Reynolds numbers of 70,000 and 100,000, corresponding to two velocities of approximately 1.42 m/s and 2.04 m/s. The tests were carried out at 12 distances from the disturbance. Sensors on the circumference of the pipeline were mounted 30° each. The correction factor values were calculated for the given measurement geometry. The measurements have shown that the values of this coefficient are always greater than 1, which means that the ultrasonic flow meter understates the speed values. They also showed that already at a distance of 8 nominal diameters from the disturbance, the correction factor does not exceed 1.02, so the measurement errors are within the maximum permissible error (MPE) of a typical ultrasonic flow meter. For distances less than eight nominal diameters from the disturbance, not taking the correction factor value into the account can lead to systematic errors of up to 10.8%. Studies have also proved that in each measurement plane behind the disturbance there are two mounting angles for the ultrasonic sensors, 60° and 240° respectively, for which the correction factor values are minimal. Additionally, using the laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) method, velocity solids were determined at individual distances from the disturbance, and the projections of velocity blocks on the appropriate plane represented velocity profiles and indicated the distances from the disturbance at which these profiles stabilise.},

abstract = {Artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed as an effective method to help multipath ultrasonic flowmeter (UFM) reduce its measurement error when determining the flowrate of complex flow field. However, the effectiveness of the ANN method heavily depends on the network architecture specified by the designer, and also the provided initial weights and layer biases. This hinders the ANN to be widely used in actual UFMs. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized ANN method (GANN) to be used in UFMs. The GA is utilized to determine ANN architecture based on its efficient parallel advantage in global search to replace traditional trial and error approach or empirical method. In addition, the initial weights and biases are optimized by GA, which is capable to avoid the network getting stuck with local minimum and qualify it for good generalization ability. Tests are implemented on numerical models simulating a six-path UFM installed downstream single or double elbows with complex flow field passing through it. Comparisons between the results of classical Gaussian quadrature, existing ANN, and proposed GANN are given for verification. The flowrate determination error of GANN is only 40% ~ 62% of existing ANN, which is extremely smaller than the Gaussian quadrature method. In addition, the output of GANN is much more stable than existing ANN, as proper initial weights and layer biases will be generated by GA for iteration process even random data are given for training.},

abstract = {Accurate average flow velocity determination is essential for flow measurement in many industries, including automotive, chemical, and oil and gas. The ultrasonic transit-time method is common for average flow velocity measurement, but current limitations restrict measurement accuracy, including fluid dynamic effects from unavoidable phenomena such as turbulence, swirls or vortices, and systematic flow meter errors in calibration or configuration. A new spatial averaging method is proposed, based on flexural ultrasonic array transducer technology, to improve measurement accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of the measurement results. A novel two-dimensional flexural ultrasonic array transducer is developed to validate this measurement method, comprising eight individual elements, each forming distinct paths to a single ultrasonic transducer. These paths are distributed in two chordal planes, symmetric and adjacent to a diametral plane. It is demonstrated that the root-mean-square deviation of the average flow velocity, computed using the spatial averaging method with the array transducer is 2.94%, which is lower compared to that of the individual paths ranging from 3.65% to 8.87% with an average of 6.90%. This is advantageous for improving the accuracy and reducing the uncertainty of classical single-path ultrasonic flow meters, and also for conventional multi-path ultrasonic flow meters through the measurement via each flow plane with reduced uncertainty. This research will drive new developments in ultrasonic flow measurement in a wide range of industrial applications.},

abstract = {Average flow velocity in a multipath transit time Ultrasonic Meter (USM) is calculated by integrating the mean flow velocities along all of the acoustic paths. Every path has a weight that represents its contribution to the average velocity. In the conventional weighting methods, the flow for the entire USM is assumed to be fully developed and symmetrical, so that each path has a fixed weight of USM's measuring range. However, if the flow is not in the ideal conditions or distorted, implementing such conventional techniques will produce measurement results with poor accuracy. To handle that problem, an advanced weighting method is thus needed, so that a set of weights of all paths is able to adapt to several circumstances. In this paper, the performance of a conventional weighting method represented by the Covered Area (CA) is compared toan advanced weighting method represented by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) analysis. In order to find the best architecture, several ANN parameters including learning rate, number of hidden layer, and neuron, are varied. The position and number of acoustic path are also varied based on the different number of USM Tomographic transducers from 10 to 16. The numerical simulation results show that the smallest RMSE for ANN with the Cascade algorithm is 0.0065 for USM Tomo 16 trans 6 paths, while in the case of CA is 2.2 10−3 for USM Tomo 12 trans 4 path. Furthermore, the sensitivity level of ANN-Cascade to the changes in number and path position is much lower than that of CA, whereas the range of ANN and CA RMSE are (6.5 10−3∼1.5 10−2) and (2.2 10−3 ∼7.6 10−2), respectively. By using tolerance within± 1% (AGA-9), the average RMSE for the testing sets is 9.1 10−3, while the ANN-Cascade and CA are 1 10−2 and 1.8 10−2.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic flowmeters have potential for wide application in natural gas and hydrogen flow measurements in China. Accurate measurement is essential; thus, data fusion of acoustic paths is of importance. A data integration method for multi-path flowmeter measurement is introduced and investigated in this study. The novel data integration method is based on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Computational fluid dynamics has been used to simulate the flows, and a laboratory scale system was established to obtain experimental measurements. The results of the simulations and experiments reveal that the method is able to reduce measurement error compared with four traditional integration methods in flow-rate measuring in a long straight pipe. Furthermore, both the simulation and experiment results validate the integration method for non-ideal flow conditions, such as flow downstream a single elbow or a 180° bend. The relative errors are within 1%, instead of more than 2%, which is typical for traditional methods.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic flowmeters play an important role in industrial production, aerospace and other fields. In this paper, a high-precision ultrasonic flowmeter based on the cross-correlation method is designed, and the commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 is used to simulate the propagation process of ultrasonic waves during flow measurement, and the implementation process of the cross-correlation algorithm is simulated by Python language. The flowmeter adopts the cross-correlation algorithm to improve the measurement accuracy of ultrasonic time of flight and adopts the method of combining FPGA and an embedded microprocessor to improve operation efficiency. In order to verify the performance of the flowmeter, we tested the flowmeter on the National Institute of Metrology and the self-built test platform, using the still water dragging method, the dynamic volume method and the field comparison method, respectively. The results show that the flowmeter has the ability to test the flow under the condition of high flow velocity (26 m/s) and a pipe diameter in the range of DN6~DN1600, that the absolute value of the relative indication error does not exceed 0.815% and that the repeatability does not exceed 0.150%. The designed ultrasonic flowmeter has high measurement accuracy, good repeatability, strong stability and a wide application range.},

abstract = {A conventional transit time ultrasonic flowmeter (USM) has a high accuracy for symmetric flow profiles but inaccurate for asymmetric flow profiles. Flow profile shapes can also change over time and difficult to predict. USM with tomographic configuration (USM-Tomo) can adapt to the flow profile changes but result in low temporal resolution. Meanwhile, USM with an adaptive weighting method can measure asymmetric flow velocity but limited to specific asymmetric flow profiles. An alternative scheme to determine adaptive weighting in various asymmetric flow profiles, we proposed a hybrid USM-Tomo. This scheme proposes programmable acoustic path configuration that could set the path mode between USM and tomography. Reducing computation of time of flight in each acoustic can be done by applying the dual-transducers technique. An adaptive weighting of hybrid USM-Tomo is calculated based on the mapping function between the set of velocity on 6 parallel paths of USM and average flow velocity from USMTomo. The mapping function is determined using machine learning, i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). In the measurement phase, the average flow velocity is determined using the mapping function with input 6 parallel acoustic paths. Based on various types of asymmetric flow profiles used in the experiment, the 6 parallel acoustic paths of USM could produce average flow velocity with error below 1% compared to USM-Tomo. Therefore, the proposed hybrid USM-Tomo scheme has potential to be an alternative scheme for flow meter in industrial application.},

abstract = {One of the most important challenges in fluid mechanics, gas dynamics, and hydraulic machinery fields is measuring the flow velocity with high accuracy. It is more important in large systems; such as thermal power stations, large scale power generations, and combined cycle power plants. The exact estimation of the measurement uncertainty inflow velocity is extremely important in evaluating the accuracy of the measurement. This work describes the problem of estimating measurement uncertainty when there are two or more dominant components of the uncertainty budget. . Two methods, analytical and numerical methods are used to study the comparative analysis for the results of determining the expanded uncertainty of measurement using two methods: analytical method and the numerical method. The analytical method uses the law of uncertainty propagation and is based on the estimation of uncertainty values of type A and B, while the numerical technique depends on the evaluation of measured samples by the Monte Carlo method using a random number generator. The aim of this article is to show the Monte Carlo method as an alternative way to determine the distribution of individual components of the measurement uncertainty budget. Also, the measurement of liquid flow velocity by an ultrasonic method has been analyzed, which is commonly used due to high measurement accuracy and non-invasiveness. Due to the complexity of the equation defining the measured flow velocity, determining the measurement uncertainty is not an easy task.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic flowmeters are widely used in natural gas measurement. In order to achieve high accuracy, it is crucial to research the acoustic field. Therefore, a new method, which has the advantages of ray acoustics and wave acoustics, is proposed based on a Gaussian beam, through which the ultrasonic propagation trajectory, propagation time and sound pressure distribution can be analyzed. In order to apply a Gaussian beam in a gas ultrasonic flowmeter, flow information is added into its equation regarding three aspects: sound speed, angular frequency and sound pressure phase. In this paper, the feasibility of the improved Gaussian beam method has been verified by simulation and experiments. Firstly, under different uniform flow velocities, errors between the new method and COMSOL simulation are less than 1%. Secondly, compared with static experiments, when 125 kHz ultrasonic transducers are used, the errors between them are within  ±6%. When a microphone is used to measure the sound pressure of a 36.2 kHz transducer, errors between them are within  ±1.4%. Finally, sound pressure under different flow velocities has been verified through a dynamic experiment. The sound pressure and experimental voltage show the same trend of change. Verification shows that the improved Gaussian beam method can be used for acoustic field research in gas ultrasonic flowmeters.},

abstract = {Most ultrasonic flowmeters utilize several wedge sensors for transmission and reception. Thus, the location and alignment of the sensors are critical factors that determine the performance of the ultrasonic flowmeter. In this study, we proposed an ultrasound liquid flowmeter utilizing a 128-element linear array transducer with a transmit delay control for varying the incidence angles of ultrasound wave transmission. The performance of the flowmeter was evaluated at flow rates of 0–50 L/min in a specially designed pipe system. Flow estimation was performed with the transit-time method using cross-correlation with phase zero-crossing for sub-sample estimation. While a single plane wave approach performed invasive electromagnetic measurements with only 74% accuracy as a reference, a multiple angular compensation method with 24 angles was proposed to increase the accuracy of measurements up to 93%. This study demonstrated the capability of the non-invasive single-sided ultrasonic flowmeter with a linear array transducer for liquid flow measurements in the metal pipe system.},

abstract = {The multi-path ultrasonic flowmeter is widely used in engineering practice, and the flow algorithm is important for its accuracy. The least-squares estimation method is simple and efficient and has good engineering application value. In practical applications, noises are inevitably introduced to the measurement process because of the flowmeter itself or flow-field interference. The results of classical least squares will deviate from reality because it lacks robustness. In this regard, two flow algorithms of multi-path ultrasonic flowmeter are proposed based on least-squares and random-sampling consensus algorithms, which are widely used in the image field. The two algorithms can resist gross errors effectively by avoiding the interference of external points in the sampling points. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, we take the double-bend flow field, which is a typical damaged flow field in engineering, as the research object, and then we compare the four algorithms. It can be seen that the two flow algorithms have higher accuracy and better robustness in the presence of interference noise.},
